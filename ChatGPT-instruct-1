Your current main.tf is a solid start for provisioning an EC2 instance with Docker and Docker Compose to run your app. However, since you're moving to a Docker-image-based deployment with a multi-container setup (frontend nginx + backend), here are some suggestions and improvements to make the Terraform config production-ready and better aligned with your Dockerized architecture:

Key things to consider/change:
1. AMI

Your current AMI is Ubuntu 20.04 minimal. Make sure it has Docker support or install Docker as you do.

Alternatively, consider using an AWS official Amazon Linux 2 AMI, which often has better Docker compatibility and lighter footprint:

ami = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id


You can add a data block for this:

data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
}

2. User Data & Provisioners

Instead of using remote-exec and file provisioners, consider baking your deployment scripts into the instance User Data or use a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions / Jenkins) to trigger deployment on the instance via SSH or CodeDeploy.

Your user_data script can:

Install Docker & Docker Compose

Pull the latest Docker images from Docker Hub

Run docker-compose up -d using a remote docker-compose.yml (downloaded or baked into the instance)

3. Managing Docker Compose file and configs

Instead of uploading the docker-compose and nginx configs via Terraform provisioners, consider:

Storing them in S3 or a version-controlled repo

Pulling them during instance startup (in user_data)

Or baking them into a custom AMI

4. Security Groups

Your SG is open on SSH (22) to 0.0.0.0/0 â€” ideally restrict SSH access to your IP range for security.

5. Elastic IP

Good to associate a static EIP for stable public IP access.

6. Scalability

This single EC2 + Docker Compose approach is fine for small projects, but for production consider:

AWS ECS / EKS or Docker Swarm for container orchestration

Auto-scaling groups behind a Load Balancer

Example of improved User Data script to pull images & run docker-compose:
user_data = <<-EOF
  #!/bin/bash
  apt-get update -y
  apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
  systemctl start docker
  systemctl enable docker
  usermod -aG docker ubuntu

  # Download docker-compose file
  curl -o /home/ubuntu/docker-compose.production.yml https://your-s3-or-github-url/docker-compose.production.yml

  # Pull latest images
  docker-compose -f /home/ubuntu/docker-compose.production.yml pull

  # Launch containers
  docker-compose -f /home/ubuntu/docker-compose.production.yml up -d
EOF

Additional Terraform data block for Amazon Linux AMI (optional):
data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
}


And then in your aws_instance:

ami = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id

Summary

Your current Terraform mostly works but could be simplified and hardened for production.

Move Docker config management outside Terraform provisioners.

Use user_data to bootstrap the instance.

Lock down SSH security group.

Push images to Docker Hub and ensure docker-compose pulls them.

Consider container orchestration for scaling.

If you want, I can help you refactor your Terraform + Docker Compose integration with a cleaner, more production-friendly example! Would you like that?

You said:
can you give me an entirely new main.tf which follows all of your recommendations?
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Here's a revamped main.tf for you that follows best practices:

Uses Amazon Linux 2 AMI (latest)

Uses a User Data script to install Docker & Docker Compose, pull your images, and run docker-compose up -d

Pulls docker-compose.production.yml from a publicly accessible URL (replace with your real S3 or GitHub raw URL)

Restricts SSH access to your IP only (update your.ip.address/32)

Keeps your existing VPC, subnet, IGW, routing, and security groups (with tightened SSH)

What you need to do:

Replace your.ip.address/32 with your real IP address for secure SSH access.

Replace "Kubernetes Key" with your actual EC2 key pair name.

Upload your docker-compose.production.yml somewhere accessible publicly (S3 bucket with public read or GitHub raw URL), and update the curl URL.

Make sure your private key path in connection is correct.

Run terraform init, terraform apply to provision.

If you want, I can also help you write the Docker Compose file or any other part of the deployment! Let me know.
